# CS50

[CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/) is an on-campus and online introductory course on computer science taught at Harvard University and Yale University.

This course teaches on how to solve problems, both with and without code, with an emphasis:
- Correctness
- Design
- Style

Topics include:
- Computational thinking
- Abstraction
- Algorithms
- Data structures, and computer science more generally 
- Problem sets inspired by the arts, humanities, social sciences, and sciences

This repo contains my solutions to some of these problem sets and projects.
